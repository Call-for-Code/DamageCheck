# DamageCheck
Proof of concept to inspect earthquake damaged building interiors. Currently under development at [https://github.com/pedrocruzio/DamageCheckAR](https://github.com/pedrocruzio/DamageCheckAR)

## Inpiration
Over 95% of schools in Puerto Rico are estimated to have an issue as a result of [short columns](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Effect-of-short-column-in-buildings_fig11_284167310). This prevents students from returning to school. If buildings can be identified and prioritized for repairs, students can return safely to class sooner.
